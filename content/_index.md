## Who am I?

I am that lazy guy that prefers writing code alone to going out with friends.
Sometimes, when I am *in vacant or in pensive mood*,
I write mediocre poems and stories.
If you ask why this weird name: **grapheo12**,
well honestly there isnâ€™t any reason at all.
It kinda sounded cool when I was a kid.
It has stuck since then.
