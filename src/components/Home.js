                Hello, I am Shubham Mishra, also known as <a href="https://grapheo12.github.io" className="blue-text">grapheo12</a>.
                I am that geek whom you seek sometimes for (maybe) automating your daily stuff.
                I write code. But when I'm bored I write poetry. I also like making memes.
                Thanks for taking interest in my life. I will keep this space to express myself as I grow up.
            </p>
        </div>
